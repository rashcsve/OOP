# Cryptocurrency - OOP principles
Client applications in JavaScript about cryptocurrencies. The main goal was to learn OOP concepts in JS. 

The project is 4 years old, it started as a school project where I learned JS basics. I refactored some old code, added classes and other ES6 features, but I decided to use the old design and, the most important, old data. So no we can see old bitcoin and etherium prices :sweat_smile:.


## Use Cases
The application has:
- a calculator to convert an amount in cryptocurrency to dollars
- a custom svg pie chart with some cryptocurrencies and their prices with custom audio sounds on click
- a podcast
- a table with cryptocurrencies with prices and searching
- a beautiful custom marque bar made with css transition to satisfy users
- a much more beatiful custom svg icon imitating bitcoin in navigtation to satisfy users even more

## Functional Requirements

The application used to have an external API, which showed current data values. Unfortunately, that API does not exist anymore, so I had to add static data.
